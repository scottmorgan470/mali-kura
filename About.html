        <h2>Mali-kura<br> A campaign with no end in sight</h2>
        <p class="text-justify textT"> France transformed its 2013 military intervention into a complex counterterrorism
          mission known as Operation Barkhane, which became the longest French overseas military operation since the end
          of the Algerian War. Over 5,000 troops remain scattered across Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad.
          They have been accompanied by approximately 15,000 men United Nations peacekeeping mission MINUSMA, the
          800-strong Takuba force and the EU Training Mission (EUTM).
          Since the completion of this task in July 2014, however, the French campaign has morphed into a much more
          ambitious, unwieldy, and intractable operation. Renamed Operation Barkhane, in its new form the effort gained
          support from an array of countries, including the United Kingdom and Sweden, and has expanded its scope across
          the Sahel region.
          Despite this extensive and seemingly ever-expanding military presence, however; European and other
          international powers have seen limited success in the region. Far from addressing the issues they were depoyed
          to resolve, this military architecture has presided over a proliferation in civilian casualties, displacement,
          and violent insurgency activities. These challenges have also spilled over into neighboring countries like
          Brukina and Niger; Furthermore, the significant security lapses have enabled trafficking networks to operate
          with impunity across the region. More alarmingly, regional security forces working in cooperation with foreign
          powers have been as brutal and careless in their conduct as the enemies they have been fighting. Since the
          beginning of the counterinsurgency efforts, Europe’s strategic partners in the Sahel have been accused of
          unlawfully targeting and killing hundreds of civilians in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali. Consequently and
          regrettably the failure of international efforts to contain armed groups and keep civilians safe, coupled with
          the corruption and weakness of civilian governments in the region, led to a wave of military coups in the
          Sahel.</p>

              legislative election and the deteriorating security situation in the north of the country. Opposition
              politics, civil societies, and religious groups led by Choguel Kokala-Maiga formed a unique movement
              called (M5) on 5th June 2020 well organise. However, this movement M5 organized multiple rallies against
              IBK (Ibrahim Boubacar Keita) government for months. which will put an end to the IBK regime by a military
              coup to accomplice the Malian revolution.
              Maiga said French troops had created an enclave in Kidal, a town in the desert region of northern Mali,
              and handed it over to a “terrorist group” known as Ansar al-Din, allegedly linked to al-Qaeda. He said the
              Malian military was banned from entering Kidal territory.</p>
